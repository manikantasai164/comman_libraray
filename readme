This is for shared libraries for Jenkins pipeline

1. Create a repo
2. Create a vars directory
3. create <filename>.groovy scripts

Note: call() function is the detault function no need to explicitly call the function from the pipeline

* Need to add the comman library in Jenkins 
    Configure Shared Libraries in Jenkins (Manage Jenkins -> System -> Global Pipeline Libraries/Global Trusted Pipeline Libraries)

=================================================================================
In scripted pipeline, need to call like below
@Library('<reponame>') _

call function, under the steps
<groovyfilename>()  -> it will consider only call() function. if we want to call other functions

Sample code:
@Library('comman_libraray') _

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
                test()  //it will consider only call function from groovy
            }
        }
         stage('Called comman library') {
            steps {
                script{
                    test()
                test.add()  //To call the other functions
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
